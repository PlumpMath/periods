Welcome to the PERIODS library.  The intention of this code is to provide a
convenient set of utilities for manipulating times, distances between times,
and both contiguous and discontiguous ranges of time.  By combining these
facilities in various ways, almost any type of time expression is possible.

Please see the documentation in doc/ for information.
